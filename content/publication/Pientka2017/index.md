abstract: In the half filled zero-energy Landau level of bilayer graphene, competing phases with spontaneously
broken symmetries and an intriguing quantum critical behavior have been predicted. Here we investigate
signatures of these broken-symmetry phases in thermal transport measurements. To this end, we calculate
the spectrum of spin and valley waves in the Î½=0 quantum Hall state of bilayer graphene. The presence of
Goldstone modes enables heat transport even at low temperatures, which can serve as compelling evidence
for spontaneous symmetry breaking. By varying external electric and magnetic fields, it is possible to
determine the nature of the symmetry breaking. Temperature-dependent measurements may yield
additional information about gapped modes.
