Superconducting hybrid materials, e.g., combining semiconductors, supercondcutors and magnetism, can host topological superconducting phases with Majorana edge modes. Majorana 
In order to improve our understanding of experimental challenges, we try to find a more realistic microscopic description of the proximity effect, e.g., in quantum wires or 2d Josephson junctions. We also investigate unconventional Josephson effects in magnetic Josephson junctions, e.g., with a ground state at nonzero phase difference.
