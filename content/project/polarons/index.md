title: Polaron dynamics
summary: Dynamics of polarons in condensed matter and cold atomic systems, in particular, nonequilibrium phenomena such as polaron drag, a novel form of Coulomb drag mediated by nonperturbative interactions or metastable polaron states that can enable lasing.

Strong interactions in certain semiconductors lead to tightly bound excitons, which are strongly coupled to fluctuations of the Fermi sea forming Fermi polarons, a phenomenon closely related to a Feshbach resonance and the crossover between Boseâ€“Einstein condensates and BCS superfluids in atomic physics. The large tunability of the excitons may enable such phenomena in a condensed-matter setup. Moreover, coupling to light may lead to intriguing nonequilibrium effects and applications in optoelectronics or quantum optics such as a Hall effect of photons.

From a broader perspective, studying dressed excitons as a relatively simple strongly interacting model system may ultimately lead to a better understanding of strong correlation effects in solids.
