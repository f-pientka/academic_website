title: Polaron dynamics
summary: We are interested in the dynamics of polarons in condensed matter and cold atomic systems. In particular, we study nonequilibrium phenomena such as polaron drag, a novel form of Coulomb drag mediated by nonperturbative interactions or metastable polaron states that can enable lasing.
